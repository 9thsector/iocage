Using UUIDs
===========

You can use shortened UUIDs!

**Example:**

Instead of typing or pasting the long UUID:

``iocage console f7253c38-01c7-11e4-bfd9-cc52afcf0d66``

Just enter the first few characters:

``iocage console f725``

If multiple jails match the short name iocage will throw a warning.

You can use the short UUIDs with any subcommand.

Also, jail TAGs can be used interchangeably with UUIDs:

``iocage console mytag``
